a little adventure game example that is able to be added onto later



# status
 - currently having an issue getting the map to show. I've tested the pieces and am almost certain it is because I dont have the list of Objects made correctly. I am studying how to properly use polymorphism in C# and get the list<Object> to hold derived classes of Object like Player, Wall, Boulder, etc.

# next up
  - get list to hold derived Objects
  - get grid to display the derived Object.asset in the list
  - add player movement by updating the posX and posY of the Player object in the list
